    <h3>15. Financial Investigations</h3>

    <p>Suspects involved in the transnational organised smuggling of fraudulent medicines are engaged in criminal
        activity that requires the transfer of large sums of money to pay for chemicals used in the production of
        fraudulent medicines, their transportation and distribution. In some instances, this will be many millions of
        dollars. Always ensure that you consider a parallel financial investigation for money laundering. These types
        of investigations can help you identify those profiting most from the crime.</p>

    <p>Steps that you can take to collect evidence of money laundering can occur at different times within your
        investigation. These include:</p>

    <p><strong>Suspect Profiling:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Obtaining court orders or warrants for examination of financial records, including bank records, phone
            records and tax returns</li>
        <li>Using services of a forensic accountant to examine financial records</li>
        <li>Conducting business and property checks</li>
    </ul>

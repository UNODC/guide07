    <h3>8. Risk Profiling</h3>

    <p>You may encounter the smuggling of fraudulent medicines under many different circumstances. You may find them in
        or on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Containers.</li>
        <li>Trucks.</li>
        <li>Vehicles.</li>
        <li>Vessels.</li>
        <li>Aircraft.</li>
        <li>Mail.</li>
        <li>People.</li>
        <li>Premises.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img class="fullWidth" src="../imgs/G10_08.svg"  /></p>

    <p>Now consider how many containers enter and leave your country every year? How many passengers fly into or out of
        your airports or how many trucks cross your border? Trying to find fraudulent medicines or other contraband
        amongst all of these circumstances is very difficult without some way to narrow your focus.</p>

    <p>To help you identify the potential smuggling of fraudulent medicines it is important that you develop or utilise
        a risk management system. This system will help you identify shipments or passengers that pose a greater risk
        of having fraudulent medicines through analysis of risk indicators. Examples of risk indicators include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Declared goods are not consistent with type of business of consignee/consignor</li>
        <li>High shipping costs for declared low value consignment <em>(shipment is not economically viable)</em></li>
        <li>Shipment is a heavier (or lighter) weight than is normal for the declared goods</li>
        <li>Description of goods on the shipping documents does not match Harmonized Systems (HS) code (<em>e.g. using
                HS code with lower rate of customs import duty</em>)</li>
        <li>Declared goods are known to be used as cover materials for smuggled goods (<em>e.g. scrap plastic, tea,
                coffee beans, fish, handicrafts, etc.</em>)</li>
        <li>Incomplete/false company names/addresses</li>
        <li>Fraudulent use of genuine company details</li>
        <li>P.O Box or hotel/ suite/ apartment address is listed</li>
        <li>Mobile phone number listed as contact point</li>
        <li>Loading/destination ports used should be consistent with consignor/consignee address</li>
        <li>Importer/exporter is recently established</li>
        <li>First time importing/ exporting</li>
        <li>Check for any known adverse compliance history (of any parties involved â€“ importer, exporter, transporter,
            logging company)</li>
        <li>Intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This list is not exhaustive; however it represents a good starting point. If you detect one or more of these
        risk indicators you should consider undertaking an inspection or search.</p>

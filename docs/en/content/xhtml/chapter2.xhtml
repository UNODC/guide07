    <h3>2. International Legal Instruments</h3>

    <p>To date there is no international instrument that is universal in scope and would provide a unanimously accepted
        definition of the falsification of medicines. Such a basis would provide a basis for preventive measures and
        the fight against the smuggling of fraudulent measures.</p>

    <p>There are several local conventions that address wider counterfeiting of goods, including medicines including
        the European Union. However, there is still some distance to go to creating a universal agreement.</p>
